This interactive map shows the meteorites that have fallen to Earth in the 21st Century. The data was collected by <a href="http://www.meteoriticalsociety.org/"> The Meteoritical Society </a> and can be found <a href="http://www.meteoriticalsociety.org/"> here </a>

This was created using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/leaflet.pdf"> leaflet </a> package in R.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)

data <- read.csv("meteorite-landings.csv")

data <- na.omit(data[, c("name","year", "reclat", "reclong")])

data <- data %>% 
  filter(year>=2001 & year<=2016) %>%
  filter(reclong<=180 & reclong>=-180 & (reclat!=0 | reclong!=0))

data <- data[, c("name", "reclat", "reclong")]

data <- rename(data, lat=reclat, lng=reclong)
